# VietnameseTicTacToe_game

## Description
We have been familiar with the legendary <b><i>Connect Four</i></b>. In this project, I will do a little tweak to the original, let’s just call it a <b><i>Connect Five Game</i></b> (aka <b><i>Vietnamese Tic Tac Toe</i></b>). Pretty much we can guess what the game will look like by its name. In this manner, players will need to have an extra move to be the winner of the game.

## Program Breakdown
* Greetings from the game.
* Demonstrate game rules to new players.
* Ask for the players’ names.
* Ask for the desired dimension of the playing board.
* DIVE INTO THE GAME.
* Each player takes turn to place their move onto the board
* Whoever reaches <b><i>FIVE</i></b> dots first will be the winner of the game. (It could be <b><u>horizontal</u></b>, <b><u>vertical</u></b> or <b><u>diagonal</u></b>).
* Ask if players wish to <b><i>restart</i></b> the game or to <b><i>quit</i></b>.
